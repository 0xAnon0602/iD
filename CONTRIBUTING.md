# Contributing to iD

Thinking of contributing to iD? High five! Here are some basics for our habits
so that you can write code that fits in perfectly.

## Javascript

We use the [Airbnb style for Javascript](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) with
only one difference:

**4 space soft tabs always for Javascript, not 2.**

No aligned `=`, no aligned arguments, spaces are either indents or the 1
space between expressions. No hard tabs, ever.

Javascript code should pass through [JSHint](http://www.jshint.com/) with no
warnings.

## HTML

There isn't much HTML in iD, but what there is is similar to JS: 4 spaces
always, indented by the level of the tree:

```html
<div>
    <div></div>
</div>
```

## CSS

Just like HTML and Javascript, 4 space soft tabs always.

```css
.radial-menu-tooltip {
    background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8);
}
```

We write vanilla CSS with no preprocessing step. Since iD targets modern browsers,
feel free to use newer features wisely.

## Tests

Test your code and make sure it passes. Our testing harness requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
and a few modules:

1. [Install node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - 'Install' will download a package for your OS
2. Go to the directory where you have checked out `iD`
3. Run `npm install`
4. Run `npm test` to see whether your tests pass or fail.

## Licensing

iD is under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/). Some of the libraries it uses
are under different licenses. If you're contributing to iD, you're contributing
WTFPL code.

## Submitting Changes

Let's say that you've thought of a great improvement to iD - a change that
turns everything red (please do not do this, we like colors other than red).

In your local copy, make a branch for this change:

    git checkout -b make-red

Make your changes to source files. By source files we mean the files in `js/`.
the `iD.js` and `iD.min.js` files in this project are autogenerated - don't edit
them.

So let's say you've changed `js/ui/confirm.js`.

1. Run `jshint src` to make sure your code is clean
2. Run tests with `npm test`
3. Commit your changes with an informative commit message
4. [Submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) to the `systemed/iD` project.
