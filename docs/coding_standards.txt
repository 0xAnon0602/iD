Coding standards and advice for iD
==================================

Objects
-------

Most of iD is written with [a js module pattern](http://macwright.org/2012/06/04/the-module-pattern.html):
that is, they do not use the `new` operator, and they use scope instead of
`this` to reference variables and functions.

Function names
--------------
Anything that creates and calls an Action should be prefixed with do:
	doSetLatLon(lat,lon)

Anything that is called by an Action, to do the actual work, should be prefixed with an underscore:
	_setLatLon(lat,lon)

and commented as such. Underscores are also used to prefix private methods.

File naming
-----------
The filename should be the name of the base class. You can add subclasses within
that file for clarity. Don't add extra classes that aren't subclasses,
unless they're not referenced from elsewhere.

Layout
------
* Soft tabs
