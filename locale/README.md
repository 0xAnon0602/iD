# Translations

At this stage in its development, iD is using an extremely minimal, simple
system for translations. This directory contains languages according to
code (de: German, fr: French, etc).

To contribute:

If you're technically-minded, clone this repository and edit the necessary
file, and you can preview your changes in-place if your system language is
set. Check out [the contributing guide for submitting changes](https://github.com/systemed/iD/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you aren't, you can still contribute! You'll still need a GitHub account, but
you can just browse to your language's file here,
click 'Edit', and edit each translated string.

Contributions to translations are under the same liberal
license as iD itself, [wtfpl](http://www.wtfpl.net/).
