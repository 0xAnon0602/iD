# Using the Inspector

The inspector is the user interface element on the right-hand side of the
page that appears when a feature is selected and allows you to edit its details.

### Selecting a Feature Type

After you add a point, line, or area, you can choose what type of feature it
is, like whether it's a highway or residential road, supermarket or cafe.
The inspector will display buttons for common feature types, and you can
find others by typing what you're looking for in the search box.

Click the 'i' in the bottom-right-hand corner of a feature type button to
learn more about it. Click a button to choose that type.

### Using Forms and Editing Tags

After you choose a feature type, or when you select a feature that already
has a type assigned, the inspector will display fields with details about
the feature like its name and address.

Below the fields you see, you can click icons to add other details,
like [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) information, wheelchair
access, and more.

At the bottom of the inspector, click 'Additional tags' to add arbitrary
other tags to the element. [Taginfo](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/) is a
great resource for learn more about popular tag combinations.

Changes you make in the inspector are automatically applied to the map.
You can undo them at any time by clicking the 'Undo' button.

### Closing the Inspector

You can close the inspector by clicking the close button in the top-right,
pressing the 'Escape' key, or clicking on the map.
