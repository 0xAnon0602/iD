# Using the Inspector

The inspector is the user interface element on the right-hand side of the
page that appears when an element is selected and allows to edit its details.

### Selecting a Preset

The inspector has two modes: the first allows you to pick a preset, or
predetermined selection of forms and tags.

Click the 'i' in the bottom-right-hand corner of a preset option to learn
more about it. Click a preset to choose it.

### Using Forms and Editing Tags

The second allows you to edit the
attributes of a map element using those forms and tags.

Below the forms you see, you can click icons to add more easy-to-use forms,
like [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org/) information, wheelchair
access, and more.

At the bottom of the inspector, click 'Additional tags' to add arbitrary
other tags to the element. [Taginfo](http://taginfo.openstreetmap.org/) is a
great resource for learn more about popular tag combinations.

Changes you make in the inspector are automatically applied to the map.
You can undo them at any time by clicking the Undo button.

### Closing the Inspector

You can close the inspector by either clicking the close button in the top-right,
pressing the 'Escape' key, or clicking on the map.
