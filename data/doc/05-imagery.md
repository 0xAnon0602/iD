# Imagery

Aerial imagery is an important resource for mapping. A combination of
airplane flyovers, satellite views, and freely-compiled sources are available
in the editor under the 'Background Settings' menu on the left.

By default a [Bing Maps](http://www.bing.com/maps/) satellite layer is
presented in the editor, but as you pan and zoom the map to new geographical
areas, new sources will become available. Some countries, like the United
States, France, and Denmark have very high-quality imagery available for some areas.

Imagery is sometimes offset from the map data because of a mistake on the
imagery provider's side. If you see a lot of roads shifted from the background,
don't immediately move them all to match the background. Instead you can adjust
the imagery so that it matches the existing data by clicking 'Fix alignment' at
the bottom of the Background Settings UI.
