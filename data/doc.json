You can create\nand improve this database.</p>\n<h2>Selecting</h2>\n<p>You can select a building by clicking on its border. This will highlight the\nbuilding and open a small tools menu and a sidebar showing more information\nabout the building.</p>\n<h2>Modifying</h2>\n<p>Sometimes buildings are incorrectly placed or have incorrect tags.</p>\n<p>To move an entire building, select it, then click the &#39;Move&#39; tool. Move your\nmouse to shift the building, and click when it&#39;s correctly placed.</p>\n<p>To fix the specific shape of a building, click and drag the points that form\nits border into better places.</p>\n<h2>Creating</h2>\n<p>One of the main questions around adding buildings to the map is that\nOpenStreetMap records buildings both as shapes and points. The rule of thumb\nis to <em>map a building as a shape whenever possible</em>, and map companies, homes,\namenities, and other things that operate out of buildings as points placed\nwithin the building shape.</p>\n<p>Start drawing a building as a shape by clicking the &#39;Area&#39; button in the top\nleft of the interface, and end it either by pressing &#39;Return&#39; on your keyboard\nor clicking on the first point drawn to close the shape.</p>\n<h2>Deleting</h2>\n<p>If a building is entirely incorrect - you can see that it doesn&#39;t exist in satellite\nimagery and ideally have confirmed locally that it&#39;s not present - you can delete\nit, which removes it from the map. Be cautious when deleting features -\nlike any other edit, the results are seen by everyone and satellite imagery\nis often out of date, so the road could simply be newly built.</p>\n<p>You can delete a building by clicking on it to select it, then clicking the\ntrash can icon or pressing the &#39;Delete&#39; key.</p>\n",

Roads can be all\nkinds: paths, highways, trails, cycleways, and more - any often-crossed\nsegment should be mappable.</p>\n<h2>Selecting</h2>\n<p>Click on a road to select it. An outline should become visible, along\nwith a small tools menu on the map and a sidebar showing more information\nabout the road.</p>\n<h3>Modifying</h3>\n<p>Often you&#39;ll see roads that aren&#39;t aligned to the imagery behind them\nor a GPS track.</p>\n<p>First click on the road you want to change. This will highlight it and show\n&#39;control points along it&#39; that you can drag to better locations. If\nyou want to add new control points for more detail, double-click a part\nof the road without a point, and one will be added.</p>\n<p>If the road connects to another road, but doesn&#39;t properly connect on\nthe map, you can drag one of its control points onto the other road in\norder to join them. Having roads connect is important for the map\nand essential for providing driving directions.</p>\n<p>You can also click the &#39;Move&#39; tool or type <code>M</code> to move the entire road at\none time, and then click again to save that movement.</p>\n<h2>Deleting</h2>\n<p>If a road is entirely incorrect - you can see that it doesn&#39;t exist in satellite\nimagery and ideally have confirmed locally that it&#39;s not present - you can delete\nit, which removes it from the map.
